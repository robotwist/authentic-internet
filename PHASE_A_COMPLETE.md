## What We Built

### 🎮 Core Combat Components

#### 1. **HeartDisplay Component**

  - Key count (top-right)
  - Item slots for A (sword) and B (equipped item)
  - Rupee counter (bottom-right)
- Responsive design for mobile
- Animation effects for collecting items
- Located: `client/src/components/UI/GameHUD.jsx`

#### 3. **Sword Attack System**
- Directional sword swipes (up, down, left, right)

- Support for 3 sword types:
  - 🗡️ Wooden Sword (1 damage)
  - ⚔️ White Sword (2 damage)
  - 🔱 Magical Sword (4 damage)
- Smooth swing animations
- Ready for sword beam at full health
- Located: `client/src/components/Combat/Sword.jsx`

#### 4. **Enemy System**
Three enemy types with unique AI:

**Octorok** 🐙

Features:
- Health bars (visual feedback)
- Damage flash effect when hit
- Death animation (💥)
- AI state management
- Collision detection with player

Located: `client/src/components/Combat/Enemy.jsx`

#### 5. **CombatManager**
Central system that orchestrates all combat:
- Manages active sword attacks
- Spawns enemies per map
- Handles collision detection (sword vs enemy, enemy vs player)
- Manages drops (hearts ❤️, rupees 💎, keys 🔑)
- Auto-collects drops when player is near
- Invincibility frame system (1 second)
- Enemy defeat handling

Located: `client/src/components/Combat/CombatManager.jsx`

---

## Technical Features

### Collision Detection
- Hitbox system for sword attacks
- Directional hitbox calculation
- Rectangle-based collision (AABB)
- Player-enemy collision
- Player-drop collection (auto-pickup)

### Damage System
- Half-heart precision (6 = 3 full hearts)
- Invincibility frames prevent damage stacking
- Visual feedback (flashing)
- Sound effect hooks ready

### Drop System
- Drops spawn at enemy position
- Float animation
- Auto-collection within 48px radius

## Integration Status

### ✅ Ready for Integration
All combat components are complete and linter-error free!

### 📋 Integration Steps (Next)
Follow `COMBAT_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` to:
1. Add combat state to GameWorld
2. Import combat components  
3. Add combat handlers (damage, heal, collect)
4. Add sword attack key binding (Z/Space)
5. Render HUD and CombatManager
6. Add invincibility CSS
7. Test end-to-end

### Estimated Integration Time
**30-45 minutes** to fully integrate into GameWorld.jsx

---

## Combat Gameplay

### Player Stats
- **Starting Health**: 3 hearts (6 half-hearts)
- **Max Health**: 16 hearts (32 half-hearts)
- **Movement**: Grid-based, one tile per press
- **Attack**: Sword swipe (300ms cooldown)
- **Invincibility**: 1 second after damage

### Enemy Stats

| Enemy | HP | Damage | AI Pattern | Drops |
|-------|----|----|-----------|-------|
| Octorok | 2 | 1 | Random | 50% heart, 30% rupee |
| Moblin | 3 | 1.5 | Chase | 50% heart, 30% rupee |
| Tektite | 2 | 1 | Jump | 50% heart, 30% rupee |

### Progression
- Wooden Sword (start) → White Sword → Magical Sword
- Heart containers from dungeon bosses
- Rupees for shop purchases
- Keys for locked doors

## What's Next

### Immediate: Integration & Testing
1. **Integrate into GameWorld** (30-45 min)
2. **Test combat loop** (player vs enemies)
3. **Add sound effects** 
4. **Balance gameplay** (enemy spawn rates, damage)

### Phase B: Screen Transitions
After combat is integrated and tested:
1. Design screen transition system
2. Implement smooth scrolling
3. Convert maps to screen-based grid
4. Add screen-specific enemy spawning

### Future Enhancements

- Boss battles with patterns
- Projectile system (sword beam, enemy attacks)
- Item usage (bombs, bow, boomerang)
- Shops and NPC trading
- Power-ups and upgrades
