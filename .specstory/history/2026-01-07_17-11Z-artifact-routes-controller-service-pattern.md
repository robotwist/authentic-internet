# Artifact routes controller service pattern (2026-01-07 17:11Z)

_**User (2026-01-07 03:53Z)**_

@artifactRoutes.js I want to refactor this monolithic route file into the Controller/Service pattern.

Create backend/controllers/artifactController.js.

Extract the business logic from the routes (CRUD operations, validation checks) and move them into named asynchronous functions in the controller (e.g., getArtifacts, createArtifact).

Keep the actual Express routing definitions in artifactRoutes.js, but have them call the controller functions.

Ensure error handling is preserved.
