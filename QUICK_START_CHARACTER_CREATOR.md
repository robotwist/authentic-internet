## 🎨 Tips for Creating Characters

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with a basic outline
2. **Use Dark Colors**: For outlines (black, dark gray)
3. **Keep It Recognizable**: At 32x32, less is more
4. **Test the Preview**: Make sure it looks good at small size
5. **Use the Erase Tool**: To refine edges
6. **Symmetry Helps**: Characters look good when symmetrical

### Example Character Ideas:
- 👤 Classic hero (green tunic, like Link)
- 🧙 Wizard (pointy hat, robe)
- 🤖 Robot (geometric shapes)
- 👾 Alien (creative colors)
- 🐱 Animal mascot
- 👻 Ghost/Spirit
- 🏃 Athlete (simple stick figure)
