# NPC Assets Information

This directory contains images for NPCs (Non-Player Characters) used in the game.

## NKD Man Extension Image

The file `nkd-man-extension.png` is a placeholder that should be replaced with an actual image of the NKD Man Chrome Extension icon or promotional image. This image is shown as a reward when players complete Level 1.

For best results:
- Use a square image (recommended dimensions: 128x128 or 256x256 pixels)
- Include a transparent background if possible
- Make sure the image clearly represents the NKD Man Extension

## Other NPC Images

The other images in this directory are used for in-game NPCs and should not be removed or altered without updating the corresponding references in the code.
